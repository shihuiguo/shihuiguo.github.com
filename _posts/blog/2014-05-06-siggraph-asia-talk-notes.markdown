When you are a PhD student (as I am now), perhaps one of the greatest achievements is to get your paper accepted to a top conference/journal, for example Siggraph in the community of computer graphics. This takes a lot of time and efforts to implement your idea, make your demo and write the paper. So my problem is when should we start writing a paper? 

Today I attended a talk given by Steve Lin from MSRA, as part of a satelite program for Siggraph Asia 2014. He gives some good suggestions on how to write a good paper. Here I would share my personal experiences in writing a paper, together with his good practices. Hope this could help some of you.
